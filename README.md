# react-native-add-image

Pops up a dialog with the upload option or take photo, and cancel as well. Under the hood we are using the react-native-image-picker package and its two main functions: launchCamera and launchImageLibrary.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    npm install react-native-add-image

## Usage

```js
import useAddImage from "react-native-add-image"

const {handleShowImagePicker} = useAddImage();

handleShowImagePicker((response) => {
    // DO THINGS
})
```
